# Narrative-Generation-from-Structure-Data
This project aims to generate human-like narratives from structured data (e.g., tables or spreadsheets) using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. It helps convert raw data into readable summaries or reports, making complex information more accessible and insightful for users.

Project Overview :---
This project is a narrative generation and analysis pipeline built using Python. It reads a structured business dataset and:
Generates human-readable narratives using template-based natural language generation.
Analyzes the sentiment of each narrative using VADER sentiment analysis.
Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization.
Applies K-Means clustering to group similar narratives.
Visualizes the key narrative terms using word clouds.
This is useful for automated business reporting, customer insight analysis, and data storytelling.

Features :---
📄 Narrative Generation from structured data (e.g., Sales, Profit, Region, Month).
😊 Sentiment Analysis using the VADER library.
📊 Clustering of Narratives using K-Means and TF-IDF.
🌥️ Word Cloud Visualization of narrative content.
📈 Silhouette Score evaluation for optimal clustering.
✅ Supports label matching to evaluate clustering accuracy if ground truth is available.

Technologies Used :---
Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TextBlob & VADER Sentiment Analyzer
WordCloud & Matplotlib
Google Colab (for file handling and visualization)

Future Enhancements :---
Incorporate GPT-based models for more dynamic narrative generation.
Support multi-language outputs.
Deploy as a web dashboard or API.
