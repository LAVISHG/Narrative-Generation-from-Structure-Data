# Narrative-Generation-from-Structure-Data
This project aims to generate human-like narratives from structured data (e.g., tables or spreadsheets) using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. It helps convert raw data into readable summaries or reports, making complex information more accessible and insightful for users.
